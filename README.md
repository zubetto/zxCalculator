# zxCalculator
Simple extensible calculator, intended to perform calculations of custom functions, that can be dynamically added from DLLs; 
Wrapper classes for the custom functions must implement ICalculate interface defined in the zxcalc.dll (therefore, projects with custom functions must reference the zxcalc.dll);
Next steps are the creation of function graphs and more attractive interface;
